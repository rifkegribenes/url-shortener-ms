## URL Shortener Microservice (Freecodecamp Project)

### User stories:

* I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.

* If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.

* When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.
